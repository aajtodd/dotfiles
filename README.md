[] Pull what we need from other dotfile managers or roll our own (since we are relatively simple right now)
[] bootstrap script to install dependencies and system tools we use
    * fzf
    * go
    * rust
    * ripgrep
    * ctags

[] helper scripts to bootstrap other things we find ourselves often toying with
    * vim-8 ?
    * virtualenv ?
    * latest gcc/g++
